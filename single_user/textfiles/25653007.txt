MDRD-derived estimation of GFR may significantly underestimate true GFR in patients with GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73m^2. It may also be unreliable in the case of: age <18 years or >70 years; pregnancy; serious co-morbid conditions; acute renal failure; extremes of body habitus/unusual diet; gross oedema. The MDRD-eGFR used here does not employ an ethnic factor for race. Estimation of the GFR using the CKD-EPI formula is more accurate than the MDRD formula at GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2, and can therefore be used to detect patients with mild renal impairment. It can be used to grade severity of renal impairment using the KDIGO 2012 recommendations. The CKD-EPI formula used here does not employ a correction factor for race.

Troponin T (high-sensitivity):
High-sensitivity Troponin T <3 ng/L

hs-Troponin T interpretation in suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): - Rule-in ACS: Value >100 ng/L (WHO rule-in level) - Rule-out ACS: Value <=14 ng/L (99th percentile level), if more than 6hrs after onset of chest pain - Less than 6hrs of chest pain and values < rule-in level require repeat sampling 3 hours later to demonstrate a rise in value. Note that Troponin results obtained from different instruments have different cut-off values and are NOT comparable. This result was obtained using a Roche instrument.

14 year old girl with nephrotic syndrome. Complication by DVT.
Creatinine 31. Proteinuria 7. ANF negative. dsDNA positive.
MICROSCOPIC:
Sections show renal biopsy with 40% medulla and 60% cortex in
which up to 46 glomeruli are seen. Glomeruli show mild to
moderate thickening of capillary walls with mild mesangial
proliferation. No segmental proliferative lesions are seen.
In the interstitium mild chronic inflammation is present, as well
as mild fibrosis but tubules and blood vessels appear normal.
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE:
13 Glomeruli
IgG and C3 : ++ granular along capillary wall
IgA and IgM : + granular along capillary wall.
ELECTRON MICROSCOPY:
Seventeen glomeruli are present on the toluidine blue sections.
Mild to moderate thickening of most capillary walls is noted with
probable widespread subepithelial deposits.
Ultrastructural examination confirms widespread subepithelial
deposits many with spikes and some incorporated. (Stages II and
III of the membranous GN pattern.)
Deposits are also seen in mesangial areas.
Eight TRIBs are seen in a grid space.
COMMENT:
The features fit with membranous GN. In a young girl with
positive dsDNA and TRIBs on EM in the biopsy, the possibility of
SLE should be strongly considered and looked for or excluded.
If this is viewed as lupus nephritis, then it would be Class V.
Activity 2/24; Chronicity 0/12.

Newborn to 6 years Up to 100 IU/mL 6 years to 12 years Up to 250 IU/mL 12 years onwards Up to 200 IU/mL The above reference ranges are guidelines, as there may be variability of ASO values within populations and seasons. An increase in ASO value 2 or more weeks after the initial result is supportive of a prior streptococcal infection. It is unusual for skin infections to produce a significant rise in ASO titre.

JAK2 G1849T (V617F) mutation detection.

Episode number: ST01558761

Result summary: No V617F mutation was detected in Exon 14 of the JAK2 gene. NCBI Reference sequence: NC_000009.12. Interpretation: The proband was clinically diagnosed with Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). DNA was extracted and the disease-acquired JAK2 V617F mutation analysed by allele-specific PCR. This mutation results in the alteration of the amino acids, which affects the protein function. Test scope and limitations: This mutation has been reported (Baxter et al, 2005)to be present in: Polycythaemia vera97% of cases Essential thrombocythaemia57% of cases Idiopathic myelofibrosis50% of cases

The assay limitations are subject to DNA degradation or heparin or other agents that inhibit PCR. The assay cannot reliably detect less than 5 positive cells per 100 normal cells.

Reference: 1.Baxter et al, (2005). Acquired mutation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in human myeloproliferative disorders. Lancet, 365, 1054-61.

Procedure: DNA extracted from blood is used for the analysis. Mutations are detected using allele-specific PCR.

Samples should be collected in EDTA tubes, placed on ice and transported to the laboratory without delay. Samples must be separated within one hour. Homocysteine metabolism is affected by diet (folate, B6 and B12), age, pregnancy and smoking. Patients with levels above the reference range should be given oral folic acid and vitamin B6.
